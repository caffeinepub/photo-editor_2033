  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive photo editing web app covering most requirements. All six REQs appear substantially addressed: image upload (REQ-1), transform tools including crop with draggable handles/rotate/flip (REQ-2), filter presets with thumbnails (REQ-3), adjustment sliders (REQ-4), export functionality (REQ-5), and dark-mode professional UI (REQ-6). A few minor gaps are noted due to omitted utility files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "At least 7 filter presets are displayed as thumbnail previews below the canvas",
      "reason": "The filterPresets utility file (frontend/src/utils/filterPresets.ts) is among the omitted files due to diff limits, so we cannot confirm whether at least 7 filter presets are actually defined. The FilterStrip component exists and maps over filters, but the actual preset count is unverifiable.",

      "requirement": "Exported image resolution matches the original uploaded image dimensions; all active filters, adjustments, and transformations are baked into the exported file",
      "reason": "The exportImageAsBlob utility is referenced in useImageExport.ts but its implementation is in frontend/src/utils/canvasTransform.ts, which was omitted from the diff due to file limits. We cannot verify that the export renders at full original resolution with all edits baked in.",
